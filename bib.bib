  abstract = {In electrical capacitance tomography, capacitance changes are used to determine the permittivity distribution in the imaging area. However, the changes are small compared to the standing capacitances, e.g. usually in the order of 10~30%. For a single channel capacitance sensor, a differential configuration having a redundant pair of electrodes can be used to cancel the standing capacitance. However, there has been no report so far introducing such differential configuration into ECT sensors. This is mainly due to the fact that an ECT sensor is composed of an array of electrodes, e.g. 8, 12 and 16 and the capacitance measurements in ECT are required to interrogate capacitances of all electrode pair combinations, which introduce significant difficulty for a differential configuration. In this paper, a novel differential ECT sensor is proposed and designed, which consists of concentrically arranged dual array electrodes. It can also be thought as an additional array of electrodes being inserted between the measuring electrodes and the outer screen of a conventional ECT sensor. The new sensor design has been validated by numerical simulation. A prototype sensor has been developed and evaluated with an FPGA based ECT measurement system, showing that with the proposed differential sensor, the dynamic range of the measured capacitance is reduced by ~80% and an average improvement of 10.8 dB in SNR is achieved.},

  abstract = {With the increasing use of low-conductivity structural and functional materials, there has been a greater need for the efficient and reliable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of these materials. One approach to evaluate low-conductivity structural and functional materials is to characterize the material dielectric property. In this thesis, capacitive sensors are developed for measuring complex permittivity of planar and cylindrical materials. For each sensor configuration, models are developed to allow for inverse determination of material permittivity from measured capacitance, therefore realizing quantitative characterization of material dielectric properties.In the first half of the thesis, coplanar concentric capacitive sensors are developed to meet the need of detecting water or excessive inhomogeneities caused by repairs in aircraft radome structures. Another important motivation is the absolute dielectric property characterization of laminar structures. Three coplanar sensor configurations are designed: the simple two-electrode concentric configuration, the interdigital spiral and the interdigital concentric configurations. Corresponding numerical models are developed to predict the sensor capacitance for given test-piece structures. The validity of the models is verified by comparing numerical predictions and measurement results. The advantage and disadvantage of each sensor configuration is discussed. For the two-electrode concentric configuration, a prototype handheld probe is also fabricated, and has detected successfully 1 cc of low contrast liquid in a simulated radome structure.Curved patch capacitive sensors, presented in the second half of the thesis, are developed with the motivation of accurate and convenient permittivity measurement of cylindrical structures. It is demonstrated that the permittivity of homogeneous dielectric rods is inferred easily from measured sensor capacitance, based on analytical and numerical models developed here. Another practical application of the curved patch capacitive sensors is the quantitative evaluation of aircraft wiring insulation condition. In this work, wires are modeled as cylindrical dielectrics with a conductive core. A numerical relationship between the complex permittivity of the insulation and the sensor capacitance and dissipation factor is established. A prototype probe, developed based on this model, has distinguished successfully degraded wires from the control ones. The feasibility of utilizing the presented capacitive approach for quantitative evaluation of aircraft wiring insulation condition is demonstrated.Although the development of the capacitive sensors in this thesis is motivated by aerospace engineering related applications, results presented in this work have the potential to be applied to other engineering fields. Potential sensor applications and recommended future research are suggested at the end of the thesis.},

So far, analysis and design were performed using a linearized approximate model of the CCS. This paper presents a nonlinear analysis of the CCS. First, a nonlinear mathematical model of the measuring process of the CCS is derived, and it is shown that the nonlinearity is affected not only by the rotor position but also by the angular size of the CCS. Second, odd harmonic errors are found to exist in the measured rotor displacement through a power series form derivation of the measuring process. Among various harmonic errors of the nonlinear gain, the third harmonic error is found to be largest one and this error can be removed by using an eight-segment CCS with 120掳 sensor angular size. Third, a nonlinear analysis of the effect of geometric errors is performed and the analysis result shows that the harmonic geometric error of a rotor is transmitted into different harmonic errors and its transmitability increases as the normalized eccentricity increases. The nonlinear analysis in this paper will give us useful information for the design and application of the CCS.},

When these capacitors are supplied with sinusoidal voltages of mutually shifted phases in a bridge system, the phase of the output voltage of the bridge changes with the mechanical angle. Simulation results show that this relationship can be linearised if the shape of the HPPs is modified. A simple proto-type has been developed in which the shaping of the HPPs gives satisfactory improved results. The phase of the output voltage is measured digitally and the relationship between the angular position and the digital output is found to be linear, with a linearity error 卤0.5% and a resolution of 3 arc minutes.},

Spindle error motion is a key index of performance in rotating machines. The CCS was developed as an alternative of probe-type sensors and applied to several rotating machine applications since the spindle error motion can be measured accurately without a significant effect of geometric errors. However, research on the CCS has so far focused on the case of two pairs of sensor units. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the general case or multi-segment CCS for a better rejection of geometric errors. This work presents generalization of the previous CCS system down to a multi-segment CCS. We first introduce a multi-segment CCS that consists of equally spaced pairs of sensor units of the same angular size on the circumference, and derive a mathematical model of the measuring process with the multi-segment CCS. Theoretical analysis using the mathematical model shows that a multi-segment CCS with pairs of sensor units can remove all harmonic errors except the th and th harmonic errors. In addition, the angular size of the multi-segment CCS is optimized to minimize the effects of geometric errors through a minimum norm approach. The optimal multi-segment CCS with pairs of sensor units has the largest sensor unit size among those which remove the th harmonic error, which is the lowest harmonic error that cannot be removed with sensor unit pairs.},

  abstract = {A capacitance sensor has been developed for measuring time-averaged void fractions in two-phase pipe flow. The electrode configuration consists of a helical cross capacitor in which is placed a dielectric tube. To render edge effects negligible guard electrodes are used. For annular and dispersed flow configurations theoretical calibration curves are derived by solving the Laplace equation. The thickness of the wall of the dielectric tube appeared to be a very important design parameter. For annular and stratified flow experimental curves are presented. For many practical flow situations the time-averaged void fraction can be determined with an absolute accuracy of 卤0.03. Due to the relatively long axial extension local void fraction measurements are not possible and for mixed flow patterns, such as intermittent flow with frothy slugs, the accuracy is less. The time-varying output signal is useful for flow pattern identification. The sensor is easy to machine and only a standard capacitance meter is needed.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT  Measurement of bulk physical properties in dielectric materials is typically performed using a parallel-plate capacitor configuration, where a dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates and the complex permittivity is found by measuring capacitance and conductance between the electrodes. Fringing electric fields exist between any two parallel conducting plates of finite length and the additional capacitance these fields add is not easily accounted for. It is important to account for edge effects in many capacitive sensing applications in order to ensure accurate results. Unfortunately, these edge effects are not easily quantifiable and are subject to change with varying sensor geometries. A quantitative relationship between fringing field strength and sensor geometry will improve the accuracy of many capacitive sensing applications. This work presents finite element simulations showing the influence of variable plate separation on fringing field effects in a system designed to measure the dielectric properties of a fluid. A quantitative relationship is established that relates the sensor response to the plate distance and fluid position. This relationship can be applied to experimental data in order to compensate for any edge effects present in the system.},

The measurements were carried out in a vertical pipe of 42 mm inner diameter, which was supplied with an air鈥搘ater mixture. Both gas and liquid superficial velocities were varied. The X-ray CT delivered 263 frames per second, while the wire-mesh sensor was operated at a frequency four times higher. Two different gas injectors were used: four orifices of 5 mm diameter for creating large bubbles and gas plugs and a sintered plate with a pore size of 100 渭m for generating a bubbly flow. It was found that the wire-mesh sensor has a significantly higher resolution than the X-ray CT. Small bubbles, which are clearly shown by the wire-mesh sensor, cannot be found in the CT images, because they cross the measuring plane before a complete scan can be performed. This causes artifacts in the reconstructed images, instead. Furthermore, there are large deviations between the quantitative information contained in the reconstructed tomographic 2D distributions and the gas fractions measured by the sensor, while the agreement is very good when the gas fraction is obtained by a direct evaluation of the X-ray attenuation along the available through-transmission chords of the tomography set-up. This shows that there is still potential for an improvement of the image reconstruction method. Concerning the wire-mesh sensor it was found that the gas fraction inside large bubbles is slightly underestimated. Furthermore, a significant distortion of large Taylor bubbles by the sensor was found for small liquid velocities up to 0.24 m/s. This effect vanished with growing superficial water velocity.},

It is designed for a pipe of 51.2 mm diameter and consists of two electrode grids with 16 electrodes each, put in the flow direction behind each other. The local instantaneous electrical conductivity is directly measured between all pairs of crossing wires, a tomographic image reconstruction is not necessary. The resulting 16 脳 16 sensitive points are equally distributed over the cross section. This resolution is sufficient to detect individual bubbles, which are imaged in several successive frames during their transition through the measuring plane. To investigate the influence on bubbles, a model of the sensor was tested in a transparent channel with a rectangular cross section of 50 脳 50 mm at liquid velocities between 0 and 0.8 m/s. A comparison with high-speed video observations has shown that the sensor causes a significant fragmentation of the bubbles. Nevertheless, the measured signals still represent the structure of the two-phase flow before it is disturbed by the sensor. Bubble sizes can therefore be determined by integrating local instantaneous gas fractions over an area of the measuring points occupied by the bubble. Bubble size distributions are obtained by analysing large assemblies of bubbles. The method was applied to study the formation of slug flow along a vertical tube. The bubble size distributions obtained show the effect of coalescence as well as bubble fragmentation.},

The system consists of high-capacity field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and fast data conversion circuits together with a specific signal processing method. In this system, digital phase-sensitive demodulation is implemented. A specific data acquisition scheme is employed to deal with residual charges in each measurement, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high excitation frequency. A high-speed USB interface is employed between the FPGA and a host PC. Software in Visual C++ has been developed to accomplish operational functions. Various tests were performed to evaluate the system, e.g. frame rate, SNR, noise level, linearity, and static and dynamic imaging. The SNR is 60.3 dB at 1542 frames sfor a 12-electrode sensor. The mean absolute error between the measured capacitance and the linear fit value is 1.6 fF. The standard deviation of the measurements is in the order of 0.1 fF. The dynamic imaging test demonstrates the advantages of high temporal resolution of the system. The experimental results indicate that the digital signal processing devices can be used to construct a high-performance ECT system.},

The sensor does not lend itself to computed tomography because the individual capacitance measurements do not represent overlapping regions of sensitivity. An evolving level-set algorithm is proposed to reconstruct a binary permittivity distribution. A mathematical construct, based on the physics of inverse-square fields, is used to approximately reconstruct shape features too small to be captured by the raw measurements. The method accommodates the non-uniform area-sensitivity of the junction capacitance measurement. Effective use of the algorithm requires active management of the convergence criterion and evolution rate. The algorithm is demonstrated on a series of phantoms as well as measurements of a voided dielectric thermal interface material using a near-field focusing sensor.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is regarded as a successful method for visualising cross-sectional distribution and measuring multi-phase flows (MPFs). Because of the “soft-field” nature of \{ECT\} and the non-linear relationship between electrical measurements and the permittivity of the measured material, image reconstruction for \{ECT\} is complicated. However, \{ECT\} offers some advantages over other tomography modalities, such as no radiation, rapid response, low cost, being non-intrusive and non-invasive, and the ability to withstand high temperature and high pressure. In principle, \{ECT\} can deal with the complexity of \{MPF\} measurement by explicitly deriving the component distributions at two adjacent planes along a pipeline. Images of the component distributions can be cross-correlated to obtain the velocity profile of the flow. Multiplying the component concentration and velocity profiles yields a measure of volumetric flow rate for each phase accurately. This paper covers the development of \{ECT\} for \{MPF\} metering and oil separator in the oil industry. The principal strategies and technologies that may be used to measure three-phase flows will be discussed, and the status of currently available tomography solutions will be reviewed. },

The variable capacitor is made in the form of two semi-cylindrical electrodes, mounted on the outer side of the wall of a dielectric pipeline through which a liquid with gaseous bubbles flows. The variation in the percentage of the gas and liquid causes the capacitance of the electrodes to be changed. Because the electrodes are connected to a resonant circuit of an oscillator tuned to high frequency of 80 MHz, the capacitance variations change the frequency of this oscillator. The changes of frequency generated by the oscillator are the measure of the gas and liquid volume ratio of a two-phase flow in the pipe. In the experiments, two half-cylinder electrodes of height of 10 mm were mounted on the outside wall of a pipe of diameter of 40 mm. The frequency deviations were up to 4 \{MHz\} when the pipe was empty or filled with water. },

  abstract = {ABSTRACT  Although the charge/discharge capacitance measuring circuit has been used for many applications, in particular for electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), its detailed dynamic performance has not been analysed and hence the circuit has not been optimised. This paper presents a further study of the charge/discharge circuit. To investigate the transient processes of the charging and discharging phases and the steady-state output of the current detector, the circuit has been analysed theoretically in the time and frequency domains and by PSpice simulation to confirm the analytical results. It is found that the non-ideal characteristics of the circuit, including the stray capacitance and ON resistance of CMOS switches used to control the charge/discharge processes, dominate the performance of the circuit. The values of the feedback capacitor and resistor in the current detector need to be carefully selected to achieve an optimised sampling rate and accuracy. The offset error of op-amps can be reduced by using differential configuration and the error due to charge injection can be compensated by frequent system calibration. Copyright 漏 2007 IFSA.},

As a key factor to extract water holdup with differential pressure method, friction factor is complicatedly associated with the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. However, due to the fact that oil and water phase can not be easily separated in emulsions, traditional quick-closing valve (QCV) method is incapable of determining water holdup, which is imperative to determine the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. In the present study, regarded as an auxiliary measurement method, an arc type conductivity probe (ATCP) is utilized to derive water holdup parameter. Combining water holdup and differential pressure information, we extract friction factor and analyze its relationship with the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. Besides, drag reduction phenomena in surfactant aqueous solution and oil-in-water emulsions are discussed as well. Finally, water holdup is predicted using differential pressure information and experimental expression of friction factor, the result of which proves the effectiveness of differential pressure method for the measurement of water holdup in oil-in-water emulsions.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference applied to electrical capacitance tomography, or other inverse problems, provides a framework for quantified model fitting. Estimation of unknown quantities of interest is based on the posterior distribution over the unknown permittivity and unobserved data, conditioned on measured data. Key components in this framework are a prior model requiring a parametrization of the permittivity and a normalizable prior density, the likelihood function that follows from a decomposition of measurements into deterministic and random parts, and numerical simulation of noise-free measurements. Uncertainty in recovered permittivities arises from measurement noise, measurement sensitivities, model inaccuracy, discretization error and a priori uncertainty; each of these sources may be accounted for and in some cases taken advantage of. Estimates or properties of the permittivity can be calculated as summary statistics over the posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Several modified Metropolis–Hastings algorithms are available to speed up this computationally expensive step. The bias in estimates that is induced by the representation of unknowns may be avoided by design of a prior density. The differing purpose of applications means that there is no single 'Bayesian' analysis. Further, differing solutions will use different modelling choices, perhaps influenced by the need for computational efficiency. We solve a reference problem of recovering the unknown shape of a constant permittivity inclusion in an otherwise uniform background. Statistics calculated in the reference problem give accurate estimates of inclusion area, and other properties, when using measured data. The alternatives available for structuring inferential solutions in other applications are clarified by contrasting them against the choice we made in our reference solution.},

The paper reviews the new EMT hardware electronics and software. The noise effects and the detectability limits of the system are given in the paper followed by the system sensitivity map analysis. Optimal image reconstructions, including the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) and non-iterative Tikhonov regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), are also discussed and applied for the system. The system has been demonstrated in real time (10 frames s −1 for 5 kHz excitation) with test phantoms that represent typical metal flow profiles such as central, annular stream and multiple streams.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of the steel flow through the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) during continuous casting presents a challenge for the instrumentation system because of the high temperature environment and the limited access to the nozzle in between the tundish and the mould. Electromagnetic inductance tomography (EMT) presents an attractive tool to visualize the steel flow profile within the SEN. In this paper, we investigate various flow regimes over a range of stopper positions and gas volume flow rates on a model of a submerged entry nozzle. A scaled (approximately 10:1) experimental rig consisting of a tundish, stopper rod, nozzle and mould was used. Argon gas was injected through the centre of the stopper rod and the behaviour of the two-phase GaInSn/argon flow was studied. The experiments were performed with GaInSn as an analogue for liquid steel, because it has similar conductive properties as molten steel and allows measurements at room temperature. The electromagnetic system used in our experiments to monitor the behaviour of the two-phase GaInSn/argon flow consisted of an array of eight equally spaced induction coils arranged around the object, a data acquisition system and a host computer. The present system operates with a sinusoidal excitation waveform with a frequency of 40 kHz and the system has a capture rate of 40 frames per second. The results show the ability of the system to distinguish the different flow regimes and to detect the individual bubbles. Sample tomographic images given in the paper clearly illustrate the different flow regimes.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) has been suggested by several groups for the contact-less mapping of the passive electrical properties of tissues via AC magnetic fields in the frequency range between several tens of kHz and several tens of MHz. Multifrequency MIT as an analog to multifrequency EIT has been tried and first image reconstructions have been demonstrated with phantoms. MIT appears to yield comparable images to EIT but offers the advantage of being non-contacting. In the beta-dispersion range of most tissues the method is challenging because the signals are very small and buried in noise. In order to minimize drifts and systematic errors fast data acquisition is therefore pivotal. This paper presents a method for single-shot MIT which allows us to acquire the data for a multifrequency image with an analog bandwidth of 50 kHz–1.5 MHz which covers a good part of the β-dispersion of many tissues. The transmit (TX) coils are simultaneously driven by individual power amplifiers with a multisinus pattern with up to 3 A pp . The amplifiers are configured as current sources so as not to perturb the excitation fields by inappropriately terminated coils. The separation of the different TX channels after reception is achieved by splitting up the carrier frequencies into individual subcarriers with a narrow spacing of at most 300 Hz. In this way every TX coil is identifiable by its own subcarrier but the whole excitation band is contained within a few kHz. The real and imaginary parts of the received signals are extracted efficiently with FFT. The system noise and the sources for low-frequency perturbations are analyzed and characterized.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a contactless method for mapping the electrical conductivity of tissue. MIT is based on the perturbation of an alternating magnetic field by a conducting object. The perturbation is detected by a voltage change in a receiver coil. At physiologically interesting frequencies (10 kHz-10 MHz) and conductivities (<2 S m -1 ) the lower limit for the relative voltage change (signal/carrier ratio = SCR) to be resolved is 10 -7 -10 -10 . A new MIT hardware has been developed consisting of a coil system with planar gradiometers and a high-resolution phase detector (PD). The gradiometer together with the PD resolves an SCR of 2.5×10 -5 (SNR = 20 dB at 150 kHz, acquisition speed: 100 ms). The system operates between 20 and 370 kHz with the possibility of extending the range up to 1 MHz. The feasibility of measuring conductivity spectra in the β-dispersion range of biological tissues is experimentally demonstrated. An improvement of the resolution towards SCR = 10 -7 with an SNR of ≥20 dB at frequencies >100 kHz is possible. On-line spectroscopy of tissue conductivity with low spatial resolution appears feasible, thus enabling applications such as non-invasive monitoring of brain oedema.},

A system using an excitation coil and a planar gradiometer was compared against a system with two coils. We constructed one excitation coil, two different sensing elements and a high-resolution phase detector. The first sensor was a PCB square spiral coil with seven turns. The second sensor was a PCB planar gradiometer with two opposite square spirals of seven turns, with a distance between centres of 8 cm. Theoretical sensitivity maps were derived from basic equations and compared with experimental data obtained at 150 kHz. The experimental sensitivity maps were obtained measuring the perturbation produced by a brass sphere of 12 mm in empty space. The advantage of using a gradiometer is that it can be adjusted to give a minimum signal for homogeneous objects, while increasing the sensitivity to local perturbations of the conductivity. Results show that a system using a planar gradiometer as detector has less demanding requirements for the electronic system than a system using simple coils.},

  abstract = {The production of phosphoric acid from natural phosphate rock by the wet process gives rise to an industrial by-product called phosphogypsum (PG). About 5tons of PG are generated per ton of phosphoric acid production, and worldwide PG generation is estimated to be around 100–280Mt per year. This by-product is mostly disposed of without any treatment, usually by dumping in large stockpiles. These are generally located in coastal areas close to phosphoric acid plants, where they occupy large land areas and cause serious environmental damage. PG is mainly composed of gypsum but also contains a high level of impurities such as phosphates, fluorides and sulphates, naturally occurring radionuclides, heavy metals, and other trace elements. All of this adds up to a negative environmental impact and many restrictions on PG applications. Up to 15% of world PG production is used to make building materials, as a soil amendment and as a set controller in the manufacture of Portland cement; uses that have been banned in most countries. The USEPA has classified PG as a “Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material” (TENORM). This work reviews the different environmental impacts associated with PG storage and disposal. The methods described in the literature to minimise the negative effects of this waste are classified by treatment type, i.e. physical, chemical, thermal, etc., and different suggested applications for PG are detailed.},

  abstract = {Presently, about 3 million tonnes of phosphogypsum are being generated annually in Spain as by-product from phosphoric acid in a fertilizer factory located in Huelva (southwestern Iberian Peninsula). Phosphate rock from Morocco is used as raw material in this process. Phosphogypsum wastes are stored in a stack containing 100Mt (approximately 1200ha of surface) over salt marshes of an estuary formed by the confluence of the Tinto and Odiel rivers, less than 1km away from the city centre. A very low proportion of this waste is used to improve fertility of agricultural soils in the area of the Guadalquivir river valley (Seville, SW Spain). The chemical speciation of potentially toxic elements (Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, Sr, U and Zn) in phosphogypsum and phosphate rock was performed using the modified BCR-sequential extraction procedure, as described by the European Community Bureau of Reference (1999). This study has been done with the main of: (1) evaluate changes in the mobility of metals during the production of phosphoric acid; (2) estimate the amount of mobile metals that can affect the environmental surrounding; and (3) verify the environmentally safe use of phosphogypsum as an amendment to agricultural soils. The main environmental concern associated to phosphoric acid production is that Uranium, a radiotoxic element, is transferred from the non-mobile fraction in the phosphate rock to the bioavailable fraction in phosphogypsum in a rate of 23%. Around 21% of Ba, 6% of Cu and Sr, 5% of Cd and Ni, and 2% of Zn are also contained in the water-soluble phase of the final waste. Considering the total mass of phosphogypsum, the amount of metals easily soluble in water is approximately 6178, 3089, 1931, 579, 232, 193 and 77t for Sr, U, Ba, Zn, Ni, Cu and Cd, respectively. This gives an idea of the pollution potential of this waste.},

The main emphasis of the paper is on cross correlation flowmeters, which are developing to a stage where they can successfully solve industrial and environmental measurement problems, ranging from the flow of highly polluted liquids in pipes to the flow of gas from volcanic jets. Cross correlation flowmeters are based on measuring the transit time of a tagging signal (turbulence, clumps of particles, etc.) in the flow between two axially separated sensors. The transit time is measured by a cross correlator. The design of the various subsystems is discussed in some detail and the various sensing techniques required for specific applications are described. Cross correlation flowmeters have become a realistic proposition because of the reducing cost of large scale integrated circuits and microprocessors from which the correlator may be realised, a number of different designs of cross correlator are described and their relative merits discussed.},

Three-dimensional (3D) electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been used to investigate the hydrodynamics in risers of different shapes. Four different ECT sensors with 12 electrodes each are designed according to the dimension of risers, including two circular ECT sensors, a square ECT sensor and a rectangular ECT sensor. The electrodes are evenly arranged in three planes to obtain capacitance in different heights and to reconstruct the 3D images by linear back projection (LBP) algorithm. Experiments were carried out on the four risers using sands as the solids material. The capacitance and differential pressure are measured under the gas superficial velocity from 0.6 m s −1 to 3.0 m s −1 with a step of 0.2 m s −1 . The flow regime is investigated according to the solids concentration and differential pressure. The dynamic property of bubbling flows is analyzed theoretically and the performance of the 3D ECT sensors is evaluated. The experimental results show that 3D ECT can be used in the CFB with different risers to predict the hydrodynamics of gas–solids bubbling flows.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomographic data collected in a lab-scale fluidized bed used for the drying of pharmaceutical granule have been corrected for the influence of moisture on the permittivity of the drying material. The correction is based on a linear least-squares fit to measurements of capacitance in a packed bed of granule at various moisture contents. X-ray tomography has been used to independently verify this correction procedure. The influence of permittivity models and number of iterations used for the reconstruction of tomograms have also been examined. It has been determined that the Böttcher permittivity model performs best at bed moistures above approximately 5 wt% while the parallel model is superior at bed moisture below this value. The reconstruction technique based on iterative linear back-projection utilized for the reconstruction of ECT data required approximately 50 iterations to successfully reproduce the density behaviour seen in the x-ray tomographs. Instability in the reconstruction technique at higher numbers of iterations indicates that a linear least-squares fit does not completely capture the response of the sensor to moisture changes. For future applications, changes in bed voidage associated with the drying of pharmaceuticals must be addressed and included in this calibration procedure in order to implement this calibration technique throughout the drying process. Nevertheless, the viability of this technique for on-line calibration of an ECT sensor applied to the drying process has been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {A current source suitable for application in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is described. The first stage of the commercially available current-feedback amplifier AD844 constitutes a current-conveyor implementation and allows the construction of wide-bandwidth current sources, thus avoiding the mismatching and temperature-induced problems that arise in discrete realizations. The lack in gain accuracy of this circuit is overcome by the inclusion of its input buffer in an operational amplifier feedback loop. Saturation problems that appear when placing a DC-blocking capacitor between the source and the electrode are solved by a DC feedback that maintains DC voltage at the output near to 0 V without reducing the output impedance of the source. Two AC-coupled current sources, in both inverting and non-inverting configurations, are described and their possible applications to EIT are listed.},

The technique generates, from the measured capacitance, a whole volumetric image of the region enclosed by the geometrically three-dimensional capacitance sensor. This development enables a real-time, 3-D imaging of a moving object or a real-time volume imaging (4-D) to be realized. Moreover, it allows total interrogation of the whole volume within the domain (vessel or conduit) of an arbitrary shape or geometry. The development of the ECVT imaging technique primarily encloses the 3-D capacitance sensor design and the volume image reconstruction technique. The electrical field variation in three-dimensional space forms a basis for volume imaging through different shapes and configurations of ECT sensor electrodes. The image reconstruction scheme is established by implementing the neural-network multicriterion optimization image reconstruction (NN-MOIRT), developed earlier by the authors for the 2-D ECT. The image reconstruction technique is modified by introducing into the algorithm a 3-D sensitivity matrix to replace the 2-D sensitivity matrix in conventional 2-D ECT, and providing additional network constraints including 3-to-2-D image matching function. The additional constraints further enhance the accuracy of the image reconstruction algorithm. The technique has been successfully verified over actual objects in the experimental conditions},

The most commonly employed current source design in EIT systems is the modified Howland circuit (MHC). The MHC requires tight matching of resistors to achieve high output impedance and may suffer from instability over a wide frequency range in an integrated solution. In this paper, we introduce a new integrated current source design in CMOS technology and compare its performance with the MHC. The new integrated design has advantages over the MHC in terms of power consumption and area. The output current and the output impedance of both circuits were determined through simulations and measurements over the frequency range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz. For frequencies up to 1 MHz, the measured maximum variation of the output current for the integrated current source is 0.8% whereas for the MHC the corresponding value is 1.5%. Although the integrated current source has an output impedance greater than 1 MOmega up to 1 MHz in simulations, in practice, the impedance is greater than 160 kOmega up to 1 MHz due to the presence of stray capacitance.},

The product quality strongly depends on the operation parameters and process conditions, e.g. inlet airflow rate, temperature and spraying flow rate. For granulation and drying processes, the flow conditions can change dramatically due to different moisture level, because of the change in physical characteristics of particles, including viscosity, density and diameter. Also, the flow regime of a fluidised bed would change with the diameter and density of particles. Due to high moisture content, particles could agglomerate and stick up to the wall and distributor plate, resulting in a fault process. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor a drying or granulation process, identify their flow regime and control the processes according to the particle properties. This paper describes an application of electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) to monitor the process conditions and for diagnosis of fault with a semi-industrial scale pharmaceutical fluidised bed. Preliminary test results with granulation and drying processes are given. Future work on fluidised bed control based on the information provided by ECT will be discussed.},

Since the flow regime present in a pipeline cannot always reliably be predicted, then online calibration of such instruments is usually required. As the range and capabilities of multiphase flowmeters increase, the problems of how to validate the performance of such instruments online also increases. This study considers the extent to which simple capacitance-sensing techniques can be used to validate the multiphase flowmeters' performance by identifying the carrier, dispersed phase(s), and flow regime in the flow stream. Finite-element analysis, using the ANSYS software, was used to predict the ability of a simple capacitance sensor to identify carrier and phase composition in a range of oil, water, and gas mixtures. The sensor parameters investigated included electrode length, electrode separation, pipe material, and the effect of guards. The results obtained were used to optimize the sensor geometry for reliable identification of carrier and phase(s). The results obtained from the simulation were experimentally verified. It was shown that a capacitance measurement technique combined with statistical and fuzzy-logic-type methods can form the basis of a simple and robust validation unit that could be retrofitted to multiphase flowmeters for online validation. Such a system could be used as an early warning system for instrument malfunctions.},

The multilinear regression (MLR) method was used for the empirical equation development using an Unscrambler 9.7 data analyzer. In this paper, a low-cost impedance analyzer designed and assembled in our laboratory was used to measure the impedance and phase angles. MC values of corn samples in the moisture range of 7% to 18% and in-shell peanuts in the moisture range of 9% to 20%, not used in the calibration, were predicted by the equations and compared with their standard air-oven values. For over 96% of the samples tested from both crops, the predicted MC values were within 1% of the air-oven values. This method, being nondestructive and rapid, will have considerable application in the drying and storage processes for peanuts, corn, and similar field crops.},

  abstract = {The thick-wall ECT system applied in high pressure is introduced, and the pipe wall thickness of ECT sensor is 5 mm. To analyse the effect of pipe wall thickness on ECT sensor, radius electrode ratio is defined as the ratio of inner and outer radius of pipeline. ANSYS and Matlab are combined to simulate sensor characteristic. Linear back projection algorithm is adopted to reconstruct the images of stratified flow, core flow and annular flow with different radius electrode ratios. The results of simulation indicate that there is a small image error under high radius electrode ratio, and the images reconstructed from stratified flow are better than those from core flow and annular flow. The independently developed ECT system is applied to identify the flow regime of gas solid flows in horizontal pipeline with 10 mm inner diameter in a pulverised coal dense-phase pneumatic conveying experimental setup. The pressure is up to 4.0 MPa and the solid gas ratio is up to 11.73 kg/kg. The experimental results of eight-electrode ECT with thick pipeline sensor, which is used on the pulverised coal dense-phase pneumatic conveying experimental setup, are given. Finally, the Fluent simulation of concentration distribution at the similar condition is introduced to validate the ECT imaging result.},

The proposed method is base on the Mann-Kendall method, which has been frequently used in abrupt climate change detection. First, the change-point of cross-sectional solid concentration values at each plane is detected separately using the M-K method; thereafter the transit time can be estimated as the difference between the change-points detected at the upstream and downstream planes. The change-point-detection-based method has released the basic assumption required by the classical cross-correlation method, and thus can increase the scope of velocity measurements. Experimental results indicate that the ECT system is capable of detecting various velocity profiles and solids distributions, which can be useful for the monitoring and predicting of flow instability and solid blockages.},

However, solid particles are charged due to the collisions between particles and pipe wall in gas鈥搒olid flow system. The charge carried by solid particles will induce a certain amount of charge on the electrode of capacitance sensor, which causes an additional output in the capacitance measurement circuit. Hence, the particle electrification causes errors in capacitance measurements, and even leads to the failure of the measurement system for solid concentration and tomography system based on capacitance sensor. In this paper, the influence of particle electrification on the AC-based capacitance measurement circuit is theoretically and experimentally investigated based on a capacitance sensor with helical surface-plate electrodes. The results indicated that the capacitance signal and the electrostatic induction signal have different frequency band ranges. The influence of charge on capacitance measurements can be eliminated by rationally designing the capacitance measurement circuit, and further accurate and reliable capacitance measurement can be achieved.},

Through the first circuit tests, applying to the proposed measurement configuration, it was possible to detect capacitance changes in the order of 100 ppm of the nominal capacitance value with a sampling frequency of 2 kHz. The state of the art measurement configurations compare the rectified measurement signal of the capacitive sensor with that of a reference capacitance. The difference signal, already having a considerable noise content because of the diode-rectification is then further amplified. The measurement configuration proposed in the study is however amplifying the difference of the unrectified signals. Owing to the rectification being applied only after the gain stage, the noise of the rectifier unit is considerably smaller compared with other solutions. This method is having further potentials especially by means of measurement speed and accuracy.},

A new C4D sensor is developed and a void fraction measurement system is constructed. As a preliminary study, the research work is focused on the void fraction measurement of two typical flow patterns (bubble flow and slug flow) in millimeter-scale horizontal pipe. The relationship between the conductance value and the void fraction is investigated. It is found that there is obvious linear relationship between the conductance value and the void fraction and flow pattern has significant influence on void fraction measurement. To overcome the influence of flow pattern, different void fraction measurement models are developed for different flow patterns. In the practical void fraction measurement process, flow pattern is firstly identified, then a corresponding void fraction measurement model is selected, and finally the void fraction measurement is implemented with the selected model and the conductance measurement obtained by the new C4D sensor. Void fraction measurement experiments are carried out (the inner diameters of the pipes are 2.8mm, 3.9mm, 5.3mm and 7.0mm, respectively). The experiment results show that the application of C4D technique to the void fraction measurement of gas鈥搇iquid two-phase flow in millimeter-scale pipe is feasible. The proposed void fraction measurement method is effective and the measurement performance is satisfactory (the maximum absolute error of void fraction measurement is less than 7%).

However, the measurement of the amount delivered can only be done in one way: isolate the components first; then meter, weigh or measure the volume for each individual component. This measuring procedure often stalls the production rate. This work implements a noninvasive, real time monitoring system to measure the flow concentration and velocity distributions of a two-phase (liquid-gas) flow. The system uses the combination of a specially designed twin-plane segmented Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) sensor with 16 portable electrodes and the cross-correlation method as the velocity measurement technique. The measured values or data from the ECT sensor will be manipulated to reconstruct the cross sectional image of the pipeline by computer programming. These images are then cross-correlated to obtain the velocity profile of the multiphase flow. The visualization results deliver information regarding the flow regime, superficial velocity and concentration distribution in two-phase flow rate measurement system. The information obtained is able to improve: the process equipment's design, verification of existing computational modeling and simulation techniques. This technique has the possibility to promote an excellent opportunity to build methods for measuring the velocity field in multiphase flow by using noninvasive technique and cross-correlating.},

Plane wave synthetic focusing (PWSF) method has been initially proposed for a linear array transducer to give a solution to the diffraction problem of interrogating beam. In this paper, to our best knowledge, we present the first report on the PWSF method for B-mode convex array imaging as well as the optimization strategies for enhancing image quality. The validation study was performed by acquiring data from a tissue-mimicking phantom (040GSE, CIRS Inc., USA) using an ultrasonic research platform (Vantage 128, Verasonics Inc., USA) with a C5-2 convex array transducer.

  abstract = {This study introduces a new approach to characterize single and multiphase flow of water and air/water blends, respectively, by means of the utilization of optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) arranged in a grid pattern. Here, the FBGs act as transducers between the force applied on the optical fiber surface by the liquid or air/liquid flow and the strain-induced Bragg wavelength shift. Since the force is proportional to the square of the velocity, associated to the kinetic energy, it is possible to establish a relationship between the Bragg wavelength shift and flow speed for single-phase flow monitoring. When multiphase flows are taken in consideration, a sudden Bragg wavelength shift represents an abrupt change in the force applied onto the fiber, which means a transition between liquid and air. It is hard to localize turbulences in single phase flow or establish the bubble position for multiphase flow from the response of a single FBG. Therefore, the sensors in this study have been arranged forming an 8 脳 8 grid, with a total of 16 different FBGs multiplexed in wavelength. FBG grid enables the detection of turbulences or air bubbles within the pipe by means of an adequate aggregation and processing of the response of the FBGs at each crossing point, with a total of 64 crossings (12 crossings are out of the cylindrical shape pipe). Different flow speeds and void conditions with distinct void fractions and flow rates have been studied. The optical fiber sensors performance agreed with that of a wire-mesh system, which is conventionally used as a reference high performance measurement tool for multiphase flow. Results showed the great potential of this technique that reduces in more than a half the costs, complexity and size of actual devices used for the same purpose.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an experimental investigation and numerical study were performed on different electrode configurations for oil-air two phase flow measurement in different patterns. The main electrode configurations are: double ring, concave and double helix that can be compared in terms of sensitivity and phase distribution immunity. For this purpose, finite element simulations were carried out to compare electrode configurations as well as experimental study. Also a new electrode shape (TRFLC) was proposed and compared with the others. The simulation results show different sensitivity for each flow pattern: for stratified regime, TRFLC and for annular regime, concave and helical shapes were more sensitive. Concave shape was strongly dependent on the flow pattern while helical and ring show less dependency. Then, an experimental set up was constructed for oil-air two phase flow in a 26.6 ID horizontal pipe. Also, a capacitance sensor with high sensitivity was designed, using those electrode configurations, to measure small changes in the capacitance values of oil-air two phase flow and converting to voltage by a transducer circuit. The sensor responses for each configuration show TRFLC and concave had the most overall sensitivity for the pipe filled with oil and air which is consistent with the results of simulation. Flow pattern detection with the concave capacitance was clearly possible without the need for signal processing, regimes such as bubbly, slug, plug and wavy, and gas-oil ratio was obtained using helical type with an absolute percentage error less than 8%. In summary, if the main objective is identification of flow regime, then the TRFLC or concave shape is preferred and on the other hand, helical shape is favored if measurement of gas fraction is the target.},

  abstract = {The lubrication condition of a radially loaded rolling element bearing mainly depends on the continuity of the oil film between friction pairs, which is critical for highly reliable electromechanical systems. To achieve the continuous online monitoring of the lubricating condition of the bearing oil film, a non-contact measuring method for both the oil film capacitance and resistance, which can be used to detect oil deterioration and film damage, is proposed. The method is implemented by measuring the complex impedance of the oil film using two electric field coupling paths instead of slip rings, thus avoiding mechanical contact with the rotating parts directly. This paper provides the equivalent circuit of the lubrication structure in the bearing and the operational principle, algorithm, and circuit implementation of the non-contact measurement. Verification experiments were carried out for a practical rotary mechanical system, obtaining the capacitance in the range of 50–300pF and the resistance in the range of 50kΩ–2MΩ with error less than 15%, which is sufficient for practical on-line lubrication monitoring. The proposed method has a wide range of applications in high-reliability, high-speed, and precise suspension systems.},

  abstract = {In this work, a novel capacitive array sensor to visualize two-phase flow by measuring liquid holdup in pipe cross-section is introduced. The measuring principle is based on the difference between electrical permittivity of the phases. The sensor consists of two copper rings being an emitter and one receiver ring. The receiver ring is divided into segments which are individually interrogated by the measuring electronics in a fast manner. In this way, flow images are directly generated from acquired signals of electrodes in a way that it visually represents the investigated flow, avoiding the use of image reconstruction algorithms as usual in tomographic techniques. The sensor is fabricated in a flexible printed-circuit board which is flush-mounted in the inner pipe wall. A measuring electronics is responsible to detect the capacitance changes in the electrodes. The introduced sensor along with the associated electronics has been tested in static and dynamic two-phase flow, both horizontally and vertically. Direct images were generated in these different situations showing satisfactory results when compared to a reference wire-mesh sensor.},

In this paper, phase distribution in an annular space are visualized by means of three-dimensional electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). A sensor with a double helical electrode arrangement is developed to facilitate 3D measurement. The sensitivity map of the sensor is generated via inner product of the values of the electric fields generated by the finite element methods. Landweber algorithm is used to reconstruct the ECT images. An experimental platform of multiphase flow detection using the 3D ECT is built and measurements of different material distributions are made. The experimental results show that this technology can identify the shapes and positions of the working medium in different positions.},

Electric capacitance tomography (ECT) is by nature sensitive to the electrical properties of a flame, facilitating combustion intensity imaging. In this study, a novel image reconstruction algorithm is developed. It is based on an enhanced regularization methodology and adequate fusion of prior knowledge in the optimization of the objective functional through which a higher spatial resolution and lower errors of the reconstructed images are realized. Simulation results show very good agreement of the reconstructed images with typical phantoms. Also, a series of experiments are carried out for a range of flow rates of fuel and air. Data are collected by the ECT sensor and hardware, and the corresponding images are reconstructed by the new algorithm. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the new method and ECT images correspond well with the variation of the combustion intensity. Further analysis agrees well with the established principle of combustion.},

The soft-field (ECT) and hard-field (UT) systems measure different physical parameters making them both a fine combination in complementing each system鈥檚 limitations. The DMT system consists of 16 units of customized ECT sensors and 16 units of UT transducers which are composited on a single-plane arrangement to perform concurrent measurement. A finite element method is used to model and study its feasibility and performance before engaging with the actual hardware. The DMT system is carried out on a vertical test column and horizontal stratified flow to obtain sensor data from each modality by inspection of separate tomographic image using linear back projection (LBP) image reconstruction algorithm and convolution back-projection with Gaussian filtering (CBPF). A fuzzy logic pixel fusion method is used for image fusion process. To evaluate the reconstructed images, the mean structural similarity index (MSSIM) method and mutual information method (MF) are employed on both the LBP and CBPF image results. The analysis and assessments proven that CBPF method has successfully improvised the image results thus has better MSSIM rating and MF over LBP method with enhancement up to 12.55% and 8.92% respectively.},

Compared to conventional methods with dual-modality tomographic systems, the approach based on thresholding takes account of multi-dimensional data, which therefore is capable of providing insights into investigated flow in both spatial and temporal terms. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, by which 6 common flow regimes in horizontal pipeline flow are visualized based on the multi-dimensional data with ERT-ECT systems, including (wavy) stratified flow, plug flow, slug flow, annular flow and bubbly flow. Although the present approach is proposed for data acquired with ERT-ECT system, it is potentially adaptable to other dual-modality tomographic systems that use concentration tomograms as inputs.},

  abstract = {An important parameter in the study of multiphase flows is the volume fraction, which is defined by the ratio between the volume occupied by a specific phase and the total volume of the mixture. This is a fundamental parameter that appears in most of the flow models and frequently is applied to assist flow pattern identification routines as well as to estimate twophase flow rates. This work presents a water volume fraction estimation method based on electrical capacitance tomography called Electrical Capacitance Tomometry (ECTM). An electrode combining strategy using rotating electrodes has been implemented to transform a 12-electrode sensor into a 2-electrode sensor, simplifying the measurement hardware circuit. This strategy increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and, consequently improve the measurement quality. Moreover, the propose ECTM method need just twelve capacitance measurements and three iteration steps to converge, providing confidence in real time applications. Simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics software and experimental results allow us to evaluate the performance of the proposed water volume fraction measurement method which presents smaller absolute errors than the conventional ECT method.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) exhibits several attractive features that are important for industrial process tomography applications. These features include low cost, high speed, and nonintrusive nature. However, due to its soft-field character, a relatively low image resolution is an outstanding challenge for ECT. While many efforts have been made to tackle this challenge by improvements in image reconstruction algorithms, relatively less has been done to enhance the basic ECT hardware sensor configuration and data acquisition process. In this paper, a new measurement acquisition strategy is introduced to increase image resolution when using adaptive ECT (AECT). The proposed strategy is based on the manipulation of synthetic electrodes plates (``metaplates'') formed by a set of combined smaller physical electrodes (segments). The synthetic electrodes are sequentially activated with partial overlap of constituent segments to provide a fine-stepped axial and/or azimuthal electronic scan along the entire sensor. Consequently, an increased number of independent capacitance measurements are made available. Reconstruction results using the proposed measurement acquisition strategy (AECT) are shown to illustrate the enhanced resolution and stability in the imaging of objects compared to conventional ECT sensors.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the latest development of an EMT system designed for use in the metal production industry such as imaging molten steel flow profiles during continuous casting. The system that has been developed is based on a commercial data acquisition board residing in a PC host computer and programmed in the LabView graphical language. The paper reviews the new EMT hardware electronics and software. The noise effects and the detectability limits of the system are given in the paper followed by the system sensitivity map analysis. Optimal image reconstructions, including the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) and non-iterative Tikhonov regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), are also discussed and applied for the system. The system has been demonstrated in real time (10 frames s −1 for 5 kHz excitation) with test phantoms that represent typical metal flow profiles such as central, annular stream and multiple streams.},

  abstract = {We evaluated analytically and experimentally the performance of a planar gradiometer as a sensing element in a system for magnetic induction tomography. A system using an excitation coil and a planar gradiometer was compared against a system with two coils. We constructed one excitation coil, two different sensing elements and a high-resolution phase detector. The first sensor was a PCB square spiral coil with seven turns. The second sensor was a PCB planar gradiometer with two opposite square spirals of seven turns, with a distance between centres of 8 cm. Theoretical sensitivity maps were derived from basic equations and compared with experimental data obtained at 150 kHz. The experimental sensitivity maps were obtained measuring the perturbation produced by a brass sphere of 12 mm in empty space. The advantage of using a gradiometer is that it can be adjusted to give a minimum signal for homogeneous objects, while increasing the sensitivity to local perturbations of the conductivity. Results show that a system using a planar gradiometer as detector has less demanding requirements for the electronic system than a system using simple coils.},

  abstract      = {This study describes a novel circuit configuration, capable of handling fast transients and small capacitance changes by the evaluation of the signals of a capacitive sensor network. The circuit is based on a conventional bridge measurement method being complemented with a control loop and high-order filters in order to cancel the effect of the environmental interference, the in-circuit noise, the propagation delay of the measuring signal and the parasitic elements. Through the first circuit tests, applying to the proposed measurement configuration, it was possible to detect capacitance changes in the order of 100 ppm of the nominal capacitance value with a sampling frequency of 2 kHz. The state of the art measurement configurations compare the rectified measurement signal of the capacitive sensor with that of a reference capacitance. The difference signal, already having a considerable noise content because of the diode-rectification is then further amplified. The measurement configuration proposed in the study is however amplifying the difference of the unrectified signals. Owing to the rectification being applied only after the gain stage, the noise of the rectifier unit is considerably smaller compared with other solutions. This method is having further potentials especially by means of measurement speed and accuracy.},

The electrodes of the 32-electrode ECVT sensor were arranged based on their structure and dimension. The sensor characteristic was explored using the Finite Element Method. Additionally, a data acquisition system with 32-channel capacitance measuring units was also developed. The imaging speed of the 32-electrode ECVT system is 130 frames/s. Simultaneously, the experimental rig for the ICFB with baffle was constructed to investigate the characteristics of particle flow under different fluidizing gas velocities. The experimental results were then compared with the reported numerical simulations of ICFB.},
