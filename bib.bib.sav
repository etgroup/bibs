  abstract = {In electrical capacitance tomography, capacitance changes are used to determine the permittivity distribution in the imaging area. However, the changes are small compared to the standing capacitances, e.g. usually in the order of 10~30%. For a single channel capacitance sensor, a differential configuration having a redundant pair of electrodes can be used to cancel the standing capacitance. However, there has been no report so far introducing such differential configuration into ECT sensors. This is mainly due to the fact that an ECT sensor is composed of an array of electrodes, e.g. 8, 12 and 16 and the capacitance measurements in ECT are required to interrogate capacitances of all electrode pair combinations, which introduce significant difficulty for a differential configuration. In this paper, a novel differential ECT sensor is proposed and designed, which consists of concentrically arranged dual array electrodes. It can also be thought as an additional array of electrodes being inserted between the measuring electrodes and the outer screen of a conventional ECT sensor. The new sensor design has been validated by numerical simulation. A prototype sensor has been developed and evaluated with an FPGA based ECT measurement system, showing that with the proposed differential sensor, the dynamic range of the measured capacitance is reduced by ~80% and an average improvement of 10.8 dB in SNR is achieved.},

  abstract = {With the increasing use of low-conductivity structural and functional materials, there has been a greater need for the efficient and reliable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of these materials. One approach to evaluate low-conductivity structural and functional materials is to characterize the material dielectric property. In this thesis, capacitive sensors are developed for measuring complex permittivity of planar and cylindrical materials. For each sensor configuration, models are developed to allow for inverse determination of material permittivity from measured capacitance, therefore realizing quantitative characterization of material dielectric properties.In the first half of the thesis, coplanar concentric capacitive sensors are developed to meet the need of detecting water or excessive inhomogeneities caused by repairs in aircraft radome structures. Another important motivation is the absolute dielectric property characterization of laminar structures. Three coplanar sensor configurations are designed: the simple two-electrode concentric configuration, the interdigital spiral and the interdigital concentric configurations. Corresponding numerical models are developed to predict the sensor capacitance for given test-piece structures. The validity of the models is verified by comparing numerical predictions and measurement results. The advantage and disadvantage of each sensor configuration is discussed. For the two-electrode concentric configuration, a prototype handheld probe is also fabricated, and has detected successfully 1 cc of low contrast liquid in a simulated radome structure.Curved patch capacitive sensors, presented in the second half of the thesis, are developed with the motivation of accurate and convenient permittivity measurement of cylindrical structures. It is demonstrated that the permittivity of homogeneous dielectric rods is inferred easily from measured sensor capacitance, based on analytical and numerical models developed here. Another practical application of the curved patch capacitive sensors is the quantitative evaluation of aircraft wiring insulation condition. In this work, wires are modeled as cylindrical dielectrics with a conductive core. A numerical relationship between the complex permittivity of the insulation and the sensor capacitance and dissipation factor is established. A prototype probe, developed based on this model, has distinguished successfully degraded wires from the control ones. The feasibility of utilizing the presented capacitive approach for quantitative evaluation of aircraft wiring insulation condition is demonstrated.Although the development of the capacitive sensors in this thesis is motivated by aerospace engineering related applications, results presented in this work have the potential to be applied to other engineering fields. Potential sensor applications and recommended future research are suggested at the end of the thesis.},

So far, analysis and design were performed using a linearized approximate model of the CCS. This paper presents a nonlinear analysis of the CCS. First, a nonlinear mathematical model of the measuring process of the CCS is derived, and it is shown that the nonlinearity is affected not only by the rotor position but also by the angular size of the CCS. Second, odd harmonic errors are found to exist in the measured rotor displacement through a power series form derivation of the measuring process. Among various harmonic errors of the nonlinear gain, the third harmonic error is found to be largest one and this error can be removed by using an eight-segment CCS with 120掳 sensor angular size. Third, a nonlinear analysis of the effect of geometric errors is performed and the analysis result shows that the harmonic geometric error of a rotor is transmitted into different harmonic errors and its transmitability increases as the normalized eccentricity increases. The nonlinear analysis in this paper will give us useful information for the design and application of the CCS.},

When these capacitors are supplied with sinusoidal voltages of mutually shifted phases in a bridge system, the phase of the output voltage of the bridge changes with the mechanical angle. Simulation results show that this relationship can be linearised if the shape of the HPPs is modified. A simple proto-type has been developed in which the shaping of the HPPs gives satisfactory improved results.

Spindle error motion is a key index of performance in rotating machines. The CCS was developed as an alternative of probe-type sensors and applied to several rotating machine applications since the spindle error motion can be measured accurately without a significant effect of geometric errors. However, research on the CCS has so far focused on the case of two pairs of sensor units. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the general case or multi-segment CCS for a better rejection of geometric errors. This work presents generalization of the previous CCS system down to a multi-segment CCS. We first introduce a multi-segment CCS that consists of equally spaced pairs of sensor units of the same angular size on the circumference, and derive a mathematical model of the measuring process with the multi-segment CCS. Theoretical analysis using the mathematical model shows that a multi-segment CCS with pairs of sensor units can remove all harmonic errors except the th and th harmonic errors. In addition, the angular size of the multi-segment CCS is optimized to minimize the effects of geometric errors through a minimum norm approach. The optimal multi-segment CCS with pairs of sensor units has the largest sensor unit size among those which remove the th harmonic error, which is the lowest harmonic error that cannot be removed with sensor unit pairs.},

The electrode configuration consists of a helical cross capacitor in which is placed a dielectric tube. To render edge effects negligible guard electrodes are used. For annular and dispersed flow configurations theoretical calibration curves are derived by solving the Laplace equation. The thickness of the wall of the dielectric tube appeared to be a very important design parameter. For annular and stratified flow experimental curves are presented. For many practical flow situations the time-averaged void fraction can be determined with an absolute accuracy of 卤0.03. Due to the relatively long axial extension local void fraction measurements are not possible and for mixed flow patterns, such as intermittent flow with frothy slugs, the accuracy is less. The time-varying output signal is useful for flow pattern identification. The sensor is easy to machine and only a standard capacitance meter is needed.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT  Measurement of bulk physical properties in dielectric materials is typically performed using a parallel-plate capacitor configuration, where a dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates and the complex permittivity is found by measuring capacitance and conductance between the electrodes. Fringing electric fields exist between any two parallel conducting plates of finite length and the additional capacitance these fields add is not easily accounted for. It is important to account for edge effects in many capacitive sensing applications in order to ensure accurate results. Unfortunately, these edge effects are not easily quantifiable and are subject to change with varying sensor geometries. A quantitative relationship between fringing field strength and sensor geometry will improve the accuracy of many capacitive sensing applications. This work presents finite element simulations showing the influence of variable plate separation on fringing field effects in a system designed to measure the dielectric properties of a fluid. A quantitative relationship is established that relates the sensor response to the plate distance and fluid position. This relationship can be applied to experimental data in order to compensate for any edge effects present in the system.},

The measurements were carried out in a vertical pipe of 42 mm inner diameter, which was supplied with an air鈥搘ater mixture. Both gas and liquid superficial velocities were varied. The X-ray CT delivered 263 frames per second, while the wire-mesh sensor was operated at a frequency four times higher. Two different gas injectors were used: four orifices of 5 mm diameter for creating large bubbles and gas plugs and a sintered plate with a pore size of 100 渭m for generating a bubbly flow. It was found that the wire-mesh sensor has a significantly higher resolution than the X-ray CT. Small bubbles, which are clearly shown by the wire-mesh sensor, cannot be found in the CT images, because they cross the measuring plane before a complete scan can be performed. This causes artifacts in the reconstructed images, instead. Furthermore, there are large deviations between the quantitative information contained in the reconstructed tomographic 2D distributions and the gas fractions measured by the sensor, while the agreement is very good when the gas fraction is obtained by a direct evaluation of the X-ray attenuation along the available through-transmission chords of the tomography set-up. This shows that there is still potential for an improvement of the image reconstruction method. Concerning the wire-mesh sensor it was found that the gas fraction inside large bubbles is slightly underestimated. Furthermore, a significant distortion of large Taylor bubbles by the sensor was found for small liquid velocities up to 0.24 m/s. This effect vanished with growing superficial water velocity.},

It is designed for a pipe of 51.2 mm diameter and consists of two electrode grids with 16 electrodes each, put in the flow direction behind each other. The local instantaneous electrical conductivity is directly measured between all pairs of crossing wires, a tomographic image reconstruction is not necessary. The resulting 16 脳 16 sensitive points are equally distributed over the cross section. This resolution is sufficient to detect individual bubbles, which are imaged in several successive frames during their transition through the measuring plane. To investigate the influence on bubbles, a model of the sensor was tested in a transparent channel with a rectangular cross section of 50 脳 50 mm at liquid velocities between 0 and 0.8 m/s. A comparison with high-speed video observations has shown that the sensor causes a significant fragmentation of the bubbles. Nevertheless, the measured signals still represent the structure of the two-phase flow before it is disturbed by the sensor. Bubble sizes can therefore be determined by integrating local instantaneous gas fractions over an area of the measuring points occupied by the bubble. Bubble size distributions are obtained by analysing large assemblies of bubbles. The method was applied to study the formation of slug flow along a vertical tube. The bubble size distributions obtained show the effect of coalescence as well as bubble fragmentation.},

The system consists of high-capacity field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and fast data conversion circuits together with a specific signal processing method. In this system, digital phase-sensitive demodulation is implemented. A specific data acquisition scheme is employed to deal with residual charges in each measurement, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high excitation frequency. A high-speed USB interface is employed between the FPGA and a host PC. Software in Visual C++ has been developed to accomplish operational functions. Various tests were performed to evaluate the system, e.g. frame rate, SNR, noise level, linearity, and static and dynamic imaging. The SNR is 60.3 dB at 1542 frames sfor a 12-electrode sensor. The mean absolute error between the measured capacitance and the linear fit value is 1.6 fF. The standard deviation of the measurements is in the order of 0.1 fF. The dynamic imaging test demonstrates the advantages of high temporal resolution of the system. The experimental results indicate that the digital signal processing devices can be used to construct a high-performance ECT system.},

The sensor does not lend itself to computed tomography because the individual capacitance measurements do not represent overlapping regions of sensitivity. An evolving level-set algorithm is proposed to reconstruct a binary permittivity distribution. A mathematical construct, based on the physics of inverse-square fields, is used to approximately reconstruct shape features too small to be captured by the raw measurements. The method accommodates the non-uniform area-sensitivity of the junction capacitance measurement. Effective use of the algorithm requires active management of the convergence criterion and evolution rate. The algorithm is demonstrated on a series of phantoms as well as measurements of a voided dielectric thermal interface material using a near-field focusing sensor.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is regarded as a successful method for visualising cross-sectional distribution and measuring multi-phase flows (MPFs). Because of the “soft-field” nature of \{ECT\} and the non-linear relationship between electrical measurements and the permittivity of the measured material, image reconstruction for \{ECT\} is complicated. However, \{ECT\} offers some advantages over other tomography modalities, such as no radiation, rapid response, low cost, being non-intrusive and non-invasive, and the ability to withstand high temperature and high pressure. In principle, \{ECT\} can deal with the complexity of \{MPF\} measurement by explicitly deriving the component distributions at two adjacent planes along a pipeline. Images of the component distributions can be cross-correlated to obtain the velocity profile of the flow. Multiplying the component concentration and velocity profiles yields a measure of volumetric flow rate for each phase accurately. This paper covers the development of \{ECT\} for \{MPF\} metering and oil separator in the oil industry. The principal strategies and technologies that may be used to measure three-phase flows will be discussed, and the status of currently available tomography solutions will be reviewed. },

The variable capacitor is made in the form of two semi-cylindrical electrodes, mounted on the outer side of the wall of a dielectric pipeline through which a liquid with gaseous bubbles flows. The variation in the percentage of the gas and liquid causes the capacitance of the electrodes to be changed. Because the electrodes are connected to a resonant circuit of an oscillator tuned to high frequency of 80 MHz, the capacitance variations change the frequency of this oscillator. The changes of frequency generated by the oscillator are the measure of the gas and liquid volume ratio of a two-phase flow in the pipe. In the experiments, two half-cylinder electrodes of height of 10 mm were mounted on the outside wall of a pipe of diameter of 40 mm. The frequency deviations were up to 4 \{MHz\} when the pipe was empty or filled with water. },

  abstract = {ABSTRACT  Although the charge/discharge capacitance measuring circuit has been used for many applications, in particular for electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), its detailed dynamic performance has not been analysed and hence the circuit has not been optimised. This paper presents a further study of the charge/discharge circuit. To investigate the transient processes of the charging and discharging phases and the steady-state output of the current detector, the circuit has been analysed theoretically in the time and frequency domains and by PSpice simulation to confirm the analytical results. It is found that the non-ideal characteristics of the circuit, including the stray capacitance and ON resistance of CMOS switches used to control the charge/discharge processes, dominate the performance of the circuit. The values of the feedback capacitor and resistor in the current detector need to be carefully selected to achieve an optimised sampling rate and accuracy. The offset error of op-amps can be reduced by using differential configuration and the error due to charge injection can be compensated by frequent system calibration. Copyright 漏 2007 IFSA.},

As a key factor to extract water holdup with differential pressure method, friction factor is complicatedly associated with the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. However, due to the fact that oil and water phase can not be easily separated in emulsions, traditional quick-closing valve (QCV) method is incapable of determining water holdup, which is imperative to determine the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. In the present study, regarded as an auxiliary measurement method, an arc type conductivity probe (ATCP) is utilized to derive water holdup parameter. Combining water holdup and differential pressure information, we extract friction factor and analyze its relationship with the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. Besides, drag reduction phenomena in surfactant aqueous solution and oil-in-water emulsions are discussed as well. Finally, water holdup is predicted using differential pressure information and experimental expression of friction factor, the result of which proves the effectiveness of differential pressure method for the measurement of water holdup in oil-in-water emulsions.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference applied to electrical capacitance tomography, or other inverse problems, provides a framework for quantified model fitting. Estimation of unknown quantities of interest is based on the posterior distribution over the unknown permittivity and unobserved data, conditioned on measured data. Key components in this framework are a prior model requiring a parametrization of the permittivity and a normalizable prior density, the likelihood function that follows from a decomposition of measurements into deterministic and random parts, and numerical simulation of noise-free measurements. Uncertainty in recovered permittivities arises from measurement noise, measurement sensitivities, model inaccuracy, discretization error and a priori uncertainty; each of these sources may be accounted for and in some cases taken advantage of. Estimates or properties of the permittivity can be calculated as summary statistics over the posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Several modified Metropolis–Hastings algorithms are available to speed up this computationally expensive step. The bias in estimates that is induced by the representation of unknowns may be avoided by design of a prior density. The differing purpose of applications means that there is no single 'Bayesian' analysis. Further, differing solutions will use different modelling choices, perhaps influenced by the need for computational efficiency. We solve a reference problem of recovering the unknown shape of a constant permittivity inclusion in an otherwise uniform background. Statistics calculated in the reference problem give accurate estimates of inclusion area, and other properties, when using measured data. The alternatives available for structuring inferential solutions in other applications are clarified by contrasting them against the choice we made in our reference solution.},

The paper reviews the new EMT hardware electronics and software. The noise effects and the detectability limits of the system are given in the paper followed by the system sensitivity map analysis. Optimal image reconstructions, including the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) and non-iterative Tikhonov regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), are also discussed and applied for the system. The system has been demonstrated in real time (10 frames s −1 for 5 kHz excitation) with test phantoms that represent typical metal flow profiles such as central, annular stream and multiple streams.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of the steel flow through the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) during continuous casting presents a challenge for the instrumentation system because of the high temperature environment and the limited access to the nozzle in between the tundish and the mould. Electromagnetic inductance tomography (EMT) presents an attractive tool to visualize the steel flow profile within the SEN. In this paper, we investigate various flow regimes over a range of stopper positions and gas volume flow rates on a model of a submerged entry nozzle. A scaled (approximately 10:1) experimental rig consisting of a tundish, stopper rod, nozzle and mould was used. Argon gas was injected through the centre of the stopper rod and the behaviour of the two-phase GaInSn/argon flow was studied. The experiments were performed with GaInSn as an analogue for liquid steel, because it has similar conductive properties as molten steel and allows measurements at room temperature. The electromagnetic system used in our experiments to monitor the behaviour of the two-phase GaInSn/argon flow consisted of an array of eight equally spaced induction coils arranged around the object, a data acquisition system and a host computer. The present system operates with a sinusoidal excitation waveform with a frequency of 40 kHz and the system has a capture rate of 40 frames per second. The results show the ability of the system to distinguish the different flow regimes and to detect the individual bubbles. Sample tomographic images given in the paper clearly illustrate the different flow regimes.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) has been suggested by several groups for the contact-less mapping of the passive electrical properties of tissues via AC magnetic fields in the frequency range between several tens of kHz and several tens of MHz. Multifrequency MIT as an analog to multifrequency EIT has been tried and first image reconstructions have been demonstrated with phantoms. MIT appears to yield comparable images to EIT but offers the advantage of being non-contacting. In the beta-dispersion range of most tissues the method is challenging because the signals are very small and buried in noise. In order to minimize drifts and systematic errors fast data acquisition is therefore pivotal. This paper presents a method for single-shot MIT which allows us to acquire the data for a multifrequency image with an analog bandwidth of 50 kHz–1.5 MHz which covers a good part of the β-dispersion of many tissues. The transmit (TX) coils are simultaneously driven by individual power amplifiers with a multisinus pattern with up to 3 A pp . The amplifiers are configured as current sources so as not to perturb the excitation fields by inappropriately terminated coils. The separation of the different TX channels after reception is achieved by splitting up the carrier frequencies into individual subcarriers with a narrow spacing of at most 300 Hz. In this way every TX coil is identifiable by its own subcarrier but the whole excitation band is contained within a few kHz. The real and imaginary parts of the received signals are extracted efficiently with FFT. The system noise and the sources for low-frequency perturbations are analyzed and characterized.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a contactless method for mapping the electrical conductivity of tissue. MIT is based on the perturbation of an alternating magnetic field by a conducting object. The perturbation is detected by a voltage change in a receiver coil. At physiologically interesting frequencies (10 kHz-10 MHz) and conductivities (<2 S m -1 ) the lower limit for the relative voltage change (signal/carrier ratio = SCR) to be resolved is 10 -7 -10 -10 . A new MIT hardware has been developed consisting of a coil system with planar gradiometers and a high-resolution phase detector (PD). The gradiometer together with the PD resolves an SCR of 2.5×10 -5 (SNR = 20 dB at 150 kHz, acquisition speed: 100 ms). The system operates between 20 and 370 kHz with the possibility of extending the range up to 1 MHz. The feasibility of measuring conductivity spectra in the β-dispersion range of biological tissues is experimentally demonstrated. An improvement of the resolution towards SCR = 10 -7 with an SNR of ≥20 dB at frequencies >100 kHz is possible. On-line spectroscopy of tissue conductivity with low spatial resolution appears feasible, thus enabling applications such as non-invasive monitoring of brain oedema.},

A system using an excitation coil and a planar gradiometer was compared against a system with two coils. We constructed one excitation coil, two different sensing elements and a high-resolution phase detector. The first sensor was a PCB square spiral coil with seven turns. The second sensor was a PCB planar gradiometer with two opposite square spirals of seven turns, with a distance between centres of 8 cm. Theoretical sensitivity maps were derived from basic equations and compared with experimental data obtained at 150 kHz. The experimental sensitivity maps were obtained measuring the perturbation produced by a brass sphere of 12 mm in empty space. The advantage of using a gradiometer is that it can be adjusted to give a minimum signal for homogeneous objects, while increasing the sensitivity to local perturbations of the conductivity. Results show that a system using a planar gradiometer as detector has less demanding requirements for the electronic system than a system using simple coils.},

  abstract = {The production of phosphoric acid from natural phosphate rock by the wet process gives rise to an industrial by-product called phosphogypsum (PG). About 5tons of PG are generated per ton of phosphoric acid production, and worldwide PG generation is estimated to be around 100–280Mt per year. This by-product is mostly disposed of without any treatment, usually by dumping in large stockpiles. These are generally located in coastal areas close to phosphoric acid plants, where they occupy large land areas and cause serious environmental damage. PG is mainly composed of gypsum but also contains a high level of impurities such as phosphates, fluorides and sulphates, naturally occurring radionuclides, heavy metals, and other trace elements. All of this adds up to a negative environmental impact and many restrictions on PG applications. Up to 15% of world PG production is used to make building materials, as a soil amendment and as a set controller in the manufacture of Portland cement; uses that have been banned in most countries. The USEPA has classified PG as a “Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material” (TENORM). This work reviews the different environmental impacts associated with PG storage and disposal. The methods described in the literature to minimise the negative effects of this waste are classified by treatment type, i.e. physical, chemical, thermal, etc., and different suggested applications for PG are detailed.},

  abstract = {Presently, about 3 million tonnes of phosphogypsum are being generated annually in Spain as by-product from phosphoric acid in a fertilizer factory located in Huelva (southwestern Iberian Peninsula). Phosphate rock from Morocco is used as raw material in this process. Phosphogypsum wastes are stored in a stack containing 100Mt (approximately 1200ha of surface) over salt marshes of an estuary formed by the confluence of the Tinto and Odiel rivers, less than 1km away from the city centre. A very low proportion of this waste is used to improve fertility of agricultural soils in the area of the Guadalquivir river valley (Seville, SW Spain). The chemical speciation of potentially toxic elements (Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, Sr, U and Zn) in phosphogypsum and phosphate rock was performed using the modified BCR-sequential extraction procedure, as described by the European Community Bureau of Reference (1999). This study has been done with the main of: (1) evaluate changes in the mobility of metals during the production of phosphoric acid; (2) estimate the amount of mobile metals that can affect the environmental surrounding; and (3) verify the environmentally safe use of phosphogypsum as an amendment to agricultural soils. The main environmental concern associated to phosphoric acid production is that Uranium, a radiotoxic element, is transferred from the non-mobile fraction in the phosphate rock to the bioavailable fraction in phosphogypsum in a rate of 23%. Around 21% of Ba, 6% of Cu and Sr, 5% of Cd and Ni, and 2% of Zn are also contained in the water-soluble phase of the final waste. Considering the total mass of phosphogypsum, the amount of metals easily soluble in water is approximately 6178, 3089, 1931, 579, 232, 193 and 77t for Sr, U, Ba, Zn, Ni, Cu and Cd, respectively. This gives an idea of the pollution potential of this waste.},

The main emphasis of the paper is on cross correlation flowmeters, which are developing to a stage where they can successfully solve industrial and environmental measurement problems, ranging from the flow of highly polluted liquids in pipes to the flow of gas from volcanic jets. Cross correlation flowmeters are based on measuring the transit time of a tagging signal (turbulence, clumps of particles, etc.) in the flow between two axially separated sensors. The transit time is measured by a cross correlator. The design of the various subsystems is discussed in some detail and the various sensing techniques required for specific applications are described. Cross correlation flowmeters have become a realistic proposition because of the reducing cost of large scale integrated circuits and microprocessors from which the correlator may be realised, a number of different designs of cross correlator are described and their relative merits discussed.},

Three-dimensional (3D) electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been used to investigate the hydrodynamics in risers of different shapes. Four different ECT sensors with 12 electrodes each are designed according to the dimension of risers, including two circular ECT sensors, a square ECT sensor and a rectangular ECT sensor. The electrodes are evenly arranged in three planes to obtain capacitance in different heights and to reconstruct the 3D images by linear back projection (LBP) algorithm. Experiments were carried out on the four risers using sands as the solids material. The capacitance and differential pressure are measured under the gas superficial velocity from 0.6 m s −1 to 3.0 m s −1 with a step of 0.2 m s −1 . The flow regime is investigated according to the solids concentration and differential pressure. The dynamic property of bubbling flows is analyzed theoretically and the performance of the 3D ECT sensors is evaluated. The experimental results show that 3D ECT can be used in the CFB with different risers to predict the hydrodynamics of gas–solids bubbling flows.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomographic data collected in a lab-scale fluidized bed used for the drying of pharmaceutical granule have been corrected for the influence of moisture on the permittivity of the drying material. The correction is based on a linear least-squares fit to measurements of capacitance in a packed bed of granule at various moisture contents. X-ray tomography has been used to independently verify this correction procedure. The influence of permittivity models and number of iterations used for the reconstruction of tomograms have also been examined. It has been determined that the Böttcher permittivity model performs best at bed moistures above approximately 5 wt% while the parallel model is superior at bed moisture below this value. The reconstruction technique based on iterative linear back-projection utilized for the reconstruction of ECT data required approximately 50 iterations to successfully reproduce the density behaviour seen in the x-ray tomographs. Instability in the reconstruction technique at higher numbers of iterations indicates that a linear least-squares fit does not completely capture the response of the sensor to moisture changes. For future applications, changes in bed voidage associated with the drying of pharmaceuticals must be addressed and included in this calibration procedure in order to implement this calibration technique throughout the drying process. Nevertheless, the viability of this technique for on-line calibration of an ECT sensor applied to the drying process has been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a contactless method for mapping the electrical conductivity of tissue. MIT is based on the perturbation of an alternating magnetic field by a conducting object. The perturbation is detected by a voltage change in a receiver coil. At physiologically interesting frequencies (10 kHz-10 MHz) and conductivities (<2 S m -1 ) the lower limit for the relative voltage change (signal/carrier ratio = SCR) to be resolved is 10 -7 -10 -10 . A new MIT hardware has been developed consisting of a coil system with planar gradiometers and a high-resolution phase detector (PD). The gradiometer together with the PD resolves an SCR of 2.5×10 -5 (SNR = 20 dB at 150 kHz, acquisition speed: 100 ms). The system operates between 20 and 370 kHz with the possibility of extending the range up to 1 MHz. The feasibility of measuring conductivity spectra in the β-dispersion range of biological tissues is experimentally demonstrated. An improvement of the resolution towards SCR = 10 -7 with an SNR of ≥20 dB at frequencies >100 kHz is possible. On-line spectroscopy of tissue conductivity with low spatial resolution appears feasible, thus enabling applications such as non-invasive monitoring of brain oedema.},

The paper reviews the new EMT hardware electronics and software. The noise effects and the detectability limits of the system are given in the paper followed by the system sensitivity map analysis. Optimal image reconstructions, including the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) and non-iterative Tikhonov regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), are also discussed and applied for the system. The system has been demonstrated in real time (10 frames s −1 for 5 kHz excitation) with test phantoms that represent typical metal flow profiles such as central, annular stream and multiple streams.},

The first stage of the commercially available current-feedback amplifier AD844 constitutes a current-conveyor implementation and allows the construction of wide-bandwidth current sources, thus avoiding the mismatching and temperature-induced problems that arise in discrete realizations. The lack in gain accuracy of this circuit is overcome by the inclusion of its input buffer in an operational amplifier feedback loop. Saturation problems that appear when placing a DC-blocking capacitor between the source and the electrode are solved by a DC feedback that maintains DC voltage at the output near to 0 V without reducing the output impedance of the source. Two AC-coupled current sources, in both inverting and non-inverting configurations, are described and their possible applications to EIT are listed.},
